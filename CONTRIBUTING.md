# Contributing to OllaLab

First off, thank you for considering contributing to OllaLab! It's people like you that make OllaLab such a great tool for the AI security community.

## Why Contribute?

OllaLab is in dire need of contributions, especially in the areas of:

1. Red team tools for text-based generative AI
2. Blue team tools for text-based generative AI
3. Relevant datasets for testing and improving AI security

Your contributions will help build a comprehensive repository that the AI security community can use to improve the robustness and security of generative AI systems.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Cybonto/OllaLab/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Cybonto/OllaLab/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with your suggestion.
- Clearly describe the enhancement and the motivation for it.
- Provide examples of how the enhancement would be used.
