# Obtaining API Keys for Different Providers

To use the Simple Chat application with various large language models (LLMs), you need to obtain API keys or credentials for each provider you wish to use. This document provides instructions for obtaining API keys for OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, Amazon Bedrock, and Anthropic.

3. After logging in, go to the [API Keys section](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
4. Click on **Create new secret key** and copy the generated API key.
5. Store this key securely, as it will only be displayed once. You will need this key to configure OpenAI in the application.

## Google Vertex AI

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Select your Google Cloud project or create a new one if necessary.
3. Enable the **Vertex AI API**:
