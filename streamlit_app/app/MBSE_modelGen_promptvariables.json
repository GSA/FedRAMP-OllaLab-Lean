        "value": "**Package Naming Convention:**\n\n* Use a hierarchical naming scheme to organize packages, similar to a file system directory structure.\n* Start with a top-level package named \"System\" or \"Model\".\n* Break down the system into functional domains, such as \"Requirements\", \"Architecture\", \"Behavior\", and \"Deployment\".\n* Create sub-packages for each domain, using meaningful names that reflect their contents (e.g., \"Requirements::Functional\", \"Architecture::Structural\").\n\nExample:\n```\nSystem\n  Requirements\n    Functional\n    Non-Functional\n  Architecture\n    Structural\n    Behavioral\n    Deployment\n```\n\n**Element Naming Convention:**\n\n* Use a clear and concise naming scheme for elements, such as blocks, components, and interfaces.\n* Follow the \"PascalCase\" convention (also known as camel case) to separate words in element names:\n\t+ Single-word names (e.g., \"Controller\", \"Sensor\").\n\t+ Compound names with multiple words separated by capital letters (e.g., \"SystemManager\", \"DataProcessor\").\n* Use descriptive names that reflect the element's purpose or function.\n* Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms unless they are widely recognized and used in your industry.\n\nExample:\n```\nBlocks\n  Controller\n  Sensor\n  SystemManager\n\nComponents\n  ProcessorUnit\n  CommunicationModule\n\nInterfaces\n  DataInterface\n  ControlInterface\n```\n\n**Relationship Naming Convention:**\n\n* Use meaningful names for relationships between elements, such as dependencies, communication channels, and control flows.\n* Start with a descriptive verb (e.g., \"Provides\", \"Uses\", \"Controls\").\n* Follow the same naming convention as element names.\n\nExample:\n```\nDependencies\n  Provides:ProcessorUnit->Sensor\n  Uses:CommunicationModule->DataInterface\n\nControlFlows\n  Controls:SystemManager->Controller\n  Monitors:Sensor->SystemManager\n```\n\n**Model Element Naming Best Practices:**\n\n* Use consistent naming conventions throughout the model.\n* Avoid using special characters, except for underscore (_) and dot (.) for package and element names.\n* Keep names concise but informative; aim for a maximum of two words.\n* Be mindful of cultural and language differences when choosing names.\n\n**SysML Version 2 Considerations:**\n\n* SysML version 2 introduces new features like parametric diagrams, use case analysis, and requirement allocation. Tailor your naming convention to accommodate these features.\n* Follow the \" SysML Best Practices\" guidelines provided by the OMG (Object Management Group) for SysML 2.\n\nBy following this robust naming convention, you'll be able to:\n\n1. Organize your model in a logical and maintainable way.\n2. Ensure consistency across different domains and packages.\n3. Clearly communicate the meaning of elements and relationships.\n4. Facilitate collaboration among stakeholders with diverse backgrounds.\n5. Meet industry best practices and standards for naming conventions.\n\n1. General Naming Principles\n\n    Clarity and Descriptiveness\n        Use clear and descriptive names that convey the purpose or function of the model element.\n        Avoid ambiguous terms and ensure names are understandable without additional context.\n\n    Consistency\n        Apply the same naming style throughout the entire model.\n        Consistency aids in navigation and reduces confusion among team members.\n\n    Avoid Unnecessary Abbreviations\n        Use full words unless abbreviations are widely recognized (e.g., GPS, HTTP).\n        Maintain a glossary for any project-specific abbreviations or acronyms.\n\n2.

        "value": "A Part represents a modular unit of a structure such as a system, system component or an external entity that may or may directly interact with the system. Parts can have features such as properties, ports, connectors. Parts can also inherit features and can be decomposed (nested) in sub-parts which are called as its owned members.\nIn SysML 2.0, with decomposition, you can decompose systems into subsystems and components. Within a diagram, parts and other elements can have owned members that allow system decomposition. Most element types can own most other element types; SysML 2.0 does not have any such restrictions, which gives you the flexibility; however, it depends on you to define your models correctly.\n\nFor example:\n\nsystem StreamlitApp {\n\n  // Define the main application part\n  part Application {\n    // Define owned members for decomposition\n    part DataModel {\n      // Attributes to describe the data model\n      attribute dataSources : String[] \n      attribute dataSchema : String\n    }\n\n    part UserInterface {\n      // Attributes to describe the UI\n      attribute layout : String\n      attribute widgets : String[]\n    }\n\n    part BackendLogic {\n      // Attributes to describe the backend logic\n      attribute functions : String[]\n      attribute libraries : String[] {\n        value = \"streamlit\", \"pandas\", \"numpy\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Define a requirement for the application\n  requirement ShallDisplayData {\n    text = \"The application shall display data from various sources in an interactive manner.\"\n  }\n\n  // Relate parts to the requirement\n  satisfy Application.DataModel : ShallDisplayData\n  satisfy Application.UserInterface : ShallDisplayData\n  satisfy Application.BackendLogic : ShallDisplayData \n}\n\nExplanation:\n\n    system StreamlitApp: Defines the overall system, which is the Streamlit application.\n    part Application: Represents the main application and acts as a container for other parts.\n        part DataModel: Represents the part responsible for handling data, including data sources and schema.\n        part UserInterface: Represents the part responsible for the user interface, including layout and widgets.\n        part BackendLogic: Represents the part responsible for the application's backend logic, including functions and libraries used (like Streamlit, pandas, and NumPy).\n    requirement ShallDisplayData: Defines a functional requirement for the application.\n    satisfy statements: Link the parts to the requirement, demonstrating how each part contributes to fulfilling the requirement.",

    "2d_PortnAttributeDefinition": {
        "value": "Ports define connection points that enable interaction between parts. You can specify the flow direction in the properties to determine the flow of the port.\nAn attribute is a data type that defines a set of data values. You can create Attribute definitions to establish and create data types. The supported attribute definitions include Integer, Real, Complex, Boolean, String among others.\n\nFor example, we have:\n\nsystem StreamlitApp {\n\n  // Define the main application part\n  part Application {\n    // Define a port for user interaction\n    port userInterface {\n      // Specify the flow direction (in and out)\n      flowDirection : inout\n      flowProperty : UserInteraction\n    }\n\n    // Define a port for data input\n    port dataIn {\n      flowDirection : in\n      flowProperty : Data\n    }\n\n    // Define a port for data output\n    port dataOut {\n      flowDirection : out\n      flowProperty : Data\n    }\n\n    // Define an attribute to store the current user session ID\n    attribute sessionID : String \n\n    // Define an attribute to store the application configuration\n    attribute config {\n      // Define the type of the attribute\n      type : Configuration\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Define an attribute definition for Configuration\n  attributeDefinition Configuration {\n    // Define attributes within the Configuration definition\n    attribute theme : String\n    attribute defaultView : String \n    attribute dataRefreshRate : Integer {\n      unit = \"seconds\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\n    part Application: Represents the main application.\n        port userInterface: This port enables interaction with the user, allowing both input from the user and output to the user (inout flow direction). It uses a UserInteraction flow property (which you would define elsewhere) to specify the type of interaction.\n        port dataIn: This port allows data to flow into the application (in flow direction) with a Data flow property.\n        port dataOut: This port enables the application to send data out (out flow direction) with a Data flow property.\n        attribute sessionID: This attribute stores the ID of the current user session as a String.\n        attribute config: This attribute stores the application's configuration. It has a type Configuration, which is a custom attribute definition.\n    attributeDefinition Configuration: This defines a new data type called Configuration. It includes attributes like theme, defaultView, and dataRefreshRate to store configuration settings.\n\nThis example demonstrates how ports and attributes are used in SysML v2. Ports define interaction points for the Application part, while attributes store data values relevant to the application's state and configuration. The use of a custom attributeDefinition shows how you can create your own data types to better structure your model.\n\nYou can further enhance this sample model by:\n\n    Connecting ports: Show how the Application part's ports connect to other parts within your system (e.g., a database, a user interface component).\n    Adding more attributes: Include attributes to store data related to user inputs, visualization settings, or application state.\n    Defining actions: Model the actions that the Application part performs, such as processUserData, fetchData, or updateVisualization.\n    Specifying requirements: Define requirements related to the application's ports and attributes, such as data input formats, user interface responsiveness, or configuration options.",

        "value": "The main categories of SysML v2 relationships are:\n\n1. Specialization:\n\nThese relationships indicate that one element is a specialized version of another, inheriting its properties and potentially adding or refining them.  \n\n    Subclassification: Creates a \"kind-of\" relationship between classifiers (like blocks, actions, or requirements). For example, a \"Car\" can be a subclassification of \"Vehicle.\"   \n\nSubsetting: Creates a \"subset-of\" relationship between instances. For example, a specific \"Ford Focus\" is a subset of \"Car.\"  \nRedefinition: Allows you to redefine features (like attributes, operations, or ports) inherited from a more general element.  \nDefinition: Links a usage of an element to its definition. For example, an ActionUsage on a block would be linked to the ActionDefinition.  \n\n2. Membership:\n\nThese relationships indicate that one element is a member or part of another element.\n\n    Feature Membership: Connects features (like attributes, operations, or ports) to the classifiers that own them.   \n\n    Part Association: Connects parts to the blocks that contain them.\n\n3.  Flow:\n\nThese relationships represent the flow of items (like data, energy, or materials) between elements.\n\n    Object Flow: Shows the flow of objects or data between actions or parts.\n    Information Flow: Shows the flow of information between elements.\n\n4.  Dependency:\n\nThese relationships indicate that one element depends on another in some way.\n\n    Usage: Shows that one element requires another element for its functionality or definition.   \n\n    Abstraction: Relates two elements that represent the same concept at different levels of abstraction.\n\n5.  Allocation:\n\nThese relationships map elements from one domain to another, such as allocating functions to components or requirements to design elements.  \n\n    Allocate: A general allocation relationship between any two elements.   \n\nSatisfy: Indicates that a design element satisfies a requirement.  \nVerify: Indicates that a test case verifies a requirement.  \nRefine: Shows that one element refines or elaborates on another element.  \nTrace: A general traceability relationship between any two elements.  \n\n6.  Connections:\n\nThese relationships connect parts through their ports, enabling interaction and flow between them.  \n\n    Connector: Represents a physical or logical connection between two or more parts.\n\nThe example below demonstrates how different types of relationships can be used in SysML v2.\n\nsystem StreamlitApp {\n\n  // Specialization: Subclassification\n  block DataComponent {\n    port dataIn {\n      flowDirection : in\n      flowProperty : Data\n    }\n  }\n\n  block Database extends DataComponent { \n    // Redefinition: Adding a new attribute\n    attribute connectionString : String\n  }\n\n  block API extends DataComponent {\n    // Redefinition: Adding a new attribute\n    attribute url : String\n  }\n\n\n  // Membership: Part Association\n  part app {\n    // Define parts within the app\n    part database : Database\n    part api : API \n    part ui : UserInterface\n  }\n\n\n  // Flow: Information Flow\n  informationFlow dataFlow {\n    // Define the source and target of the flow\n    source : app.database.dataIn \n    target : app.ui\n    // Conveyed information\n    item : Data\n  }\n\n\n  // Dependency: Usage\n  requirement DataVisualization {\n    text = \"The application shall visualize data in interactive charts.\"\n  }\n\n  // The UI part uses the Plotly library\n  usage ui : Plotly {\n    // Describe the usage\n    text = \"The UserInterface part uses the Plotly library for creating charts.\"\n  }\n\n  // Allocation: Satisfy\n  satisfy app.ui : DataVisualization\n\n\n  // Connections: Connector\n  connector dataConnection {\n    // Connect the ports of the parts\n    end1 : app.database.dataIn\n    end2 : app.api.dataIn\n  }\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\n    Specialization:\n        DataComponent is a general block for data components.\n        Database and API are specialized blocks that inherit from DataComponent (Subclassification).\n        Both Database and API add their own specific attributes (Redefinition).\n\n    Membership:\n        The app part has database, api, and ui as its parts (Part Association).\n\n    Flow:\n        dataFlow represents the flow of data from the database to the UI (Information Flow).\n\n    Dependency:\n        The ui part uses the Plotly library (which you would need to define elsewhere in the model) for visualization (Usage).\n\n    Allocation:\n        The app.ui part satisfies the DataVisualization requirement (Satisfy).\n\n    Connections:\n        dataConnection connects the dataIn ports of the database and api parts (Connector).",

Generalization (generalize) and Specialization (specialize)\n\nThese relationships denote inheritance between requirements, where a specialized requirement inherits attributes from a generalized one.\n\n    Generalization (generalize):\n\n        Description: A high-level requirement that defines common features for a set of lower-level requirements.\n\n        Use Case: Establishing a base requirement that can be specialized.\n\n        Example:\n            Requirement FR-011 (\"User Management\") generalizes Requirements FR-012 (\"Create User\") and FR-013 (\"Delete User\").\n\n        requirement FR-011 {\n            name: \"User Management\"\n            description: \"The system shall manage user accounts.\"\n            generalize: [FR-012, FR-013]\n        }\n\n        requirement FR-012 {\n            name: \"Create User\"\n            description: \"The system shall allow administrators to create new user accounts.\"\n        }\n\n        requirement FR-013 {\n            name: \"Delete User\"\n            description: \"The system shall allow administrators to delete existing user accounts.\"\n        }\n\n9. Dependency (dependsOn)\n\n    Description: Indicates that one requirement is dependent on the fulfillment of another.\n\n    Use Case: Managing prerequisites where certain requirements must be met before others can be addressed.\n\n    Example:\n        Requirement FR-014 (\"Advanced Reporting\") depends on Requirement FR-015 (\"Data Aggregation\").\n\nrequirement FR-014 {\n    name: \"Advanced Reporting\"\n    description: \"The system shall provide advanced reporting capabilities for data analysis.\"\n    dependsOn: FR-015\n}\n\nrequirement FR-015 {\n    name: \"Data Aggregation\"\n    description: \"The system shall aggregate data from various sources for unified reporting.\"\n}",

    "4a_ActionDefinition": {
        "value": "SysML 2 Actions are used to model processes that describe the functional behavior of a system. They capture a set of steps that are executed in a predetermined sequence. These steps may comprise conditions and repetitions of steps based on certain conditions. The use of Actions in a model enables system engineers to specify and analyze the behavior of a system by defining the processes used by critical system functions.\nSuccessions are a special type of connections that are used to control the sequence between Actions and other SysML 2 elements. A succession asserts that an action can start execution only if its previous action has ended. Successions can be used to connect all Occurrences (Actions and Parts are Occurrences).\nA Perform Action is an Action usage that specifies that an action is being performed by the owner of the Perform Action usage. The Perform Action is referential, allowing the performed action behavior to be defined in a different context. A Perform Action can be a feature of a Part definition or a Part usage, specifying that the referenced action is performed by the containing part during its lifetime. A Perform Action can also be a feature of an Action definition or an Action usage, representing a call from the containing action to the performed action.\nAn Assignment Action is a usage that is used to change the value of a referent feature of a target occurrence. The target is specified as the result of an expression and the referent is specified as a feature chain relative to that target. The new value for the feature is determined as the result of a different expression. When the assignment action usage completes, the referent feature has the new assigned value for the target occurrence.\nA Send Action transfers an item from the source Action element to a target Action element. You can create a Send Action usage only within the Action usages such as; Action usage, If Action, While Action, For Action, Assignment Action.\nThe Accept Action usage receives the item that is sent by the Send Action usage.\n\nFor example:\nsystem StreamlitApp {\n\n  // Define an Action to fetch data from a source\n  action fetchData(source : String) : Data {\n    // Define input and output parameters\n\n    // Action internals could be further detailed with \n    // assignment actions, send actions, etc. if needed\n  }\n\n  // Define an Action to process the data\n  action processData(data : Data) : ProcessedData {\n    // ... Action internals ...\n  }\n\n  // Define an Action to display the data\n  action displayData(data : ProcessedData)  {\n    // ... Action internals ...\n  }\n\n  // Define a Part for the application's backend\n  part Backend {\n    // Perform the fetchData action\n    perform fetchData(source = \"database\")\n  }\n\n  // Define a Part for the application's UI\n  part UI {\n    // Perform the displayData action\n    perform displayData\n  }\n\n  // Define a succession between the Actions\n  succession dataProcessing {\n    // Specify the order of execution\n    previous : Backend.fetchData\n    next : UI.displayData\n  }\n\n  // Example of an Assignment Action within fetchData\n  // (This is inside the action definition, not shown here for brevity)\n  // assignment setAPIKey {\n  //   target : this // 'this' refers to the current action\n  //   referent : apiKey // Assuming 'apiKey' is an attribute of the action\n  //   valueExpression : \"your_api_key\" \n  // }\n\n  // Example of Send/Accept Action between fetchData and processData\n  // (These would be inside the respective action definitions)\n  // send sendDataToProcessing {\n  //   target : processData // Send to the processData action\n  //   item : data // Send the 'data' item\n  // }\n\n  // accept receiveDataFromFetch {\n  //   source : fetchData // Receive from the fetchData action\n  //   item : data // Receive the 'data' item\n  // } \n}\n\nExplanation:\n\n    action fetchData, processData, displayData: These define actions representing key functions in the Streamlit app: fetching data, processing it, and displaying it.\n    part Backend and part UI: These parts represent the backend and UI components of the application.\n    perform fetchData and perform displayData: These are Perform Actions within the parts, specifying that the Backend part performs fetchData and the UI part performs displayData.\n    succession dataProcessing: This Succession defines the execution order, ensuring that displayData starts only after fetchData is complete.\n    (Commented out) assignment setAPIKey: This illustrates an Assignment Action that could be used within fetchData to assign a value to an apiKey attribute.\n    (Commented out) send sendDataToProcessing and accept receiveDataFromFetch: These illustrate how Send and Accept Actions could be used to transfer data between fetchData and processData.",

A Fork has one incoming Succession and multiple outgoing Successions. All outgoing Successions are triggered when the incoming Succession is triggered. The actions connected to the outgoing successions cannot start until the action connected to the incoming succession has completed.\nA Join node is a control node that represents the joining of control in a model. A Join node has multiple incoming successions and only one outgoing succession. The action connected to the outgoing succession cannot start until all the actions connected to the incoming successions have completed.\nA Decision node is a node that represents a control decision in the model. A decision node has one incoming Succession and one or multiple outgoing Successions. Any one of the actions connected to an outgoing succession can start after the action connected to the incoming succession has completed, which of the outgoing Succession starts is based on the guards placed on the outgoing successions.\nA Merge node is a control node that represents the merging of its incoming Successions and the merging of control in the model.
