# Schema Extractor - Dev Strategy

**Robust Development Strategy Based on Module Dependencies**

Developing a complex application like the Data Schema Extractor requires careful planning to ensure that all components work seamlessly together. Below is a robust development strategy that takes into account the dependencies among our proposed files and modules. This strategy emphasizes modular development, unit testing, and iterative enhancements to build a reliable and maintainable application.

### 1. **Understand and Map Dependencies**

Before starting development, it's crucial to understand how each module interacts with others. Here's a high-level overview of the dependencies:

- **`main.py`**: Entry point; depends on the navigation logic to pages.
- **`pages/Schema_Extractor.py`**: Central Streamlit page; depends on `file_uploader`, `sanitizer`, and `ui_components`.
- **`schema_extractor/` Modules**:
  - **`file_uploader.py`**: Independent; used by `Schema_Extractor.py`.
  - **`sanitizer.py`**: Depends on data from `file_uploader`.
  - **`ui_components.py`**: Depends on Streamlit and is used across other modules for UI elements.
  - **`utils.py`**: Contains utility functions; can be utilized by all other modules.
  - **`serialized_data_processor.py`, `tabular_data_processor.py`, `unstructured_data_processor.py`**: Depend on sanitized data, `utils`, and may utilize `schema_builder`.
  - **`schema_builder.py`**: Central to building and validating schemas; depends on data processors.
- **`tests/` Modules**: Correspond to each module; depend on the respective modules they are testing.

### 2. **Establish Development Phases**

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup**

- **Version Control**: Initialize a Git repository to track changes and facilitate collaboration.
- **Environment Setup**: Create a virtual environment and set up necessary dependencies using a `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`.
- **Project Structure**: Set up the proposed folder structure within the repository.

**Phase 2: Develop Foundational Modules**

1. **`utils.py`**

   - **Reason**: Often contains helper functions that other modules rely on.
   - **Action**: Implement essential utility functions like `detect_file_type`, `backup_data`, `handle_duplicates`, and `detect_sensitive_data`.
   - **Testing**: Write unit tests in `test_utils.py` to verify each utility function.

2. **`file_uploader.py`**

   - **Reason**: Entry point for user data; minimal dependencies.
   - **Action**: Implement the file upload functionality with proper file type detection.
   - **Testing**: Create `test_file_uploader.py` to test file uploads with different file types and sizes.

3. **`ui_components.py`**

   - **Reason**: Provides UI elements used across the application.
   - **Action**: Develop basic UI components such as selection boxes and display functions.
   - **Testing**: Use `test_ui_components.py` to test UI rendering (may involve integration tests).

**Phase 3: Implement Data Sanitization**

4. **`sanitizer.py`**

   - **Reason**: Processes data output from `file_uploader` before further processing.
   - **Action**: Implement data sanitization functions, handling issues like malformed data, harmful characters, and duplicates.
   - **Testing**: Write `test_sanitizer.py` to test sanitization logic with various data inputs.

**Phase 4: Develop Data Processors**

5. **Data Processors** (`serialized_data_processor.py`, `tabular_data_processor.py`, `unstructured_data_processor.py`)

   - **Reason**: Core functionalities for data processing depend on sanitized data.
   - **Action**:
     - Start with one processor, e.g., `tabular_data_processor.py`.
     - Implement data loading, EDA, schema extraction, and validation functions.
     - Ensure each processor can function independently.
     - Utilize `utils.py` and `schema_builder.py` as needed.
   - **Testing**: Create corresponding test files (`test_tabular_data_processor.py`, etc.) to validate each processor with mock data.

**Phase 5: Build Schema Construction and Validation**

6. **`schema_builder.py`**

   - **Reason**: Central to creating and validating data schemas.
   - **Action**: Implement schema building functions that can handle different data types.
   - **Testing**: Use `test_schema_builder.py` to ensure schemas are correctly built and validation works as expected.

**Phase 6: Integrate into the Streamlit App**

7. **`pages/Schema_Extractor.py`**

   - **Reason**: Brings together all modules within the Streamlit interface.
   - **Action**:
     - Integrate previously developed modules.
     - Implement the main workflow: file upload → sanitization → processing option selection → data processing → schema building → validation.
     - Use `ui_components.py` for consistent UI elements.
   - **Testing**: Perform integration testing to verify the end-to-end flow.

8. **`main.py`**

   - **Reason**: Entry point of the application.
   - **Action**: Set up navigation to `Schema_Extractor.py` and any other pages.
   - **Testing**: Ensure the app launches correctly and navigation works.

### 3. **Adopt Best Practices**

**Modular Development**

- Develop each module as a self-contained unit with clear inputs and outputs.
- Ensure modules do not have circular dependencies.
- Keep functions focused on single responsibilities.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

- Write unit tests before or alongside the implementation of each function.
- Use a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest`.
- Achieve high test coverage to catch issues early.

**Documentation**

- Use comprehensive doc-strings for modules, classes, and functions.
- Maintain a `README.md` with setup instructions and usage examples.
- Generate API documentation if desired (e.g., using Sphinx).

**Version Control and Branching Strategy**

- Use feature branches for developing individual modules or features.
- Regularly merge changes into the `develop` or `main` branch after code reviews.
- Tag releases when reaching stable milestones.

**Continuous Integration (CI)**

- Set up a CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or Jenkins).
- Automate testing on each commit to the repository.
- Optionally, automate deployments to a hosting platform.

**Code Quality and Style**

- Adhere to PEP 8 coding standards.
- Use linters like `flake8` or `pylint` to enforce code quality.
- Format code using tools like `black` or `autopep8`.

**Error Handling and Logging**

- Implement robust error handling in each module.
- Use Python's `logging` module to log important events and errors.
- Ensure sensitive information is not logged.
